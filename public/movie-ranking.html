<h1>The Best Movies According to Isaac</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Holes</h3>
<p>This is a great movie and a great book! Shia Lebouff is a great actor of my time and plays this dynamic character that gets falsely accused of stealing an important pair of shoes then findshimself in a series of events somehow, remarkably connected to his family's past!</p>
<h3>Mrs. Doubtfire</h3>
<p>Robert Willaims (RIP) plays a dad of 3 children and gets divorced by his wife. Although a loving and caring father, having just lost his job, he is unable to claim custody of his children and he undergoes a transformation into a caring nanny that gets hired by his wife.</p>
<h3>Great Gatsby</h3>
<p>Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's book, this film was produced by Jay Z and as such has impactful musical selections and great acting and story from Toby McGuire and Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
